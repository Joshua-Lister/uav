## An investigation into drone delivery in urban and rural areas
## Dependencies
This code has been compiled with C++20

## Introduction
Software for delivery of parcels with the use of autonomous drones or otherwise known as UAVs. The software is able to read in data from the text file "postal_data.txt" and formulate an optimal route for a delivery trucks of drones & parcels to take and calculates the total predicted cost of the journey. Unlike in other drone delivery software, a drone can be used to deliver to more than one address on its flight path given that the total distance and parcel mass for the drone is under the specified limits. This maximises the usage of a single drone. Delivery trucks are limited by their volume capacity on how many drones & parcels they can hold. With allowing a drone to fly to more than one address if possible, it reduces the total number of drones required to deliver to the addresses in "postal_data.txt" and reduces the total cost of the journey.
